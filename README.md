## Game Of Life
The purpose of this project is to add logic to buttons that will update the 2d matrix of cells for each simulation.
- 'step' will run and render one step of the simulation
- 'play' will step the simulation every 100 milliseconds
- 'pause' will stop the simulation
- the simulation should be borderless
- improve styling or user experience if possible
- play simulation at different speeds

## Time Breakdown
~30 min setting up, writing out my plan  
~1hr 30min for basic requirements of the project ie. flushing out step(), adding functionality to play and pause  
~30 min working on style changes, and ability to change speed  
~1hr trying different things to add on as a bonus. ran out of time in the 4hr limit. fixed up bugs with remaining time.

*Other things I would add  
- showing which buttons are active  
- implementing the 'stamp' feature to place objects with a click  
- allowing user to draw on the canvas for testing custom simulations  
- resetting the canvas to original state
